Hi, Iâ€™m Simone and this is my personal blog.

I work as an Embedded Firmware Engineer at [Selene Electronics](http://www.selene-electronics.it/?lang=en). <br>
Previously I worked as an iOS Developer at [WorkAngel](https://www.lifeworks.com/us) and [Wigwamm](http://www.wigwamm.com).

I'm also passionate about iOS Reverse Engineering and security.
